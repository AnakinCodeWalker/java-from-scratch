        example { 1 , 6 , 3 , 9, 2  }  here 9 is greatest do it will be swapped with 2
       now find the 2nd largest  which is 6 swap  6 in correct position
        { 1 , 6 , 3 , 2 } { 9 } we ignore 9 now because it is sorted
        { 1 , 2 , 3 } {6 , 9} now ignore until 6
        find the 3rd largest
         { 1 , 2 , 3 } is in correct position no change
         ignore until 3
         find the last greatest element
         which is 2 and it is in right position array is now sorted


        { 1 , 6 , 3 , 9, 2  } ; --> before sorting
        { 1 , 2 , 3, 6 , 9} ; --> after sorting.
