// code is not correct

/*

third = second;
second = first;
first = arr[i];
That would only work if you're updating all three in one go, and you're
* sure the current element is bigger than all three.
But in the loop, you're checking one condition at a time â€” and only
* updating when needed.
* So that shortcut doesn't apply safely in all cases.
*
* "We write third = second; second = first; when we are sure the previous
*  value is bigger than the current one, and we want
*  to update them in one place."
